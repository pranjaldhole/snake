- The game consists, as of now, two versions:
    + Simple
    + Slither
- The simple version has the most basic logical version without much complications. If you're a developer or someone who wants to get into how to program basic games using `pygame`, this version would serve an a good example.
- Slither consists of slightly more elaborate graphics and gameplay strategies. Play this version for awesome gaming experience.
